 * -Implement a well-formedness checker for the ConCL language. For this you must use the AST. 
 * - Hint: Map regular CST arguments (e.g., *, +, ?) to lists 
 * - Hint: Map lexical nodes to Rascal primitive types (bool, int, str)
 * - Hint: Use switch to do case distinction with concrete patterns

 /*
 * Create a function called checkHardwareConfiguration(...), which is responsible for calling all the required functions that check the program's well-formedness as described in the PDF (Section 3.2.) 
 * This function takes as a parameter the program's AST and returns true if the program is well-formed or false otherwise.
